# Valentine Alert! 💘

A playful, interactive Valentine’s Day webpage that will steal your heart… literally!  

This is a fun, romantic game where the **“No” button runs away**, leaving only **“Yes 💖”** as the way forward. Complete the steps, enjoy animations, confetti, and floating hearts, and unlock a sweet Valentine message at the end.  

Perfect for sending to your crush or just spreading some love online.
